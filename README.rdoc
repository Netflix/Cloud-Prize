= FAQ

Q: How do I actually contribute?

A: This repo that you will fork is just a readme. To apply, you add in your submission to your fork, which you derive from all of the other open source software[https://github.com/Netflix/] in the Netflix Github account.  For example, perhaps you have a way to improve the Netflix Graph[https://github.com/Netflix/netflix-graph] with a new data structure.  Write a new Monkey in any language you want.  Rewrite the entire platform in Erlang.  Pretty much any addition or extension will be considered!

Q: Aren't you just doing this to get a bunch of free work?

A: NO!  We truly believe that we are building the missing piece between AWS and running your software in the cloud.  We've heard from multiple ex-employees that they wish they could have taken the platform with them to their startup.  We want to make that possible for anyone to do, and we want to give you prizes for helping us make that a reality.

Good luck and thanks!
